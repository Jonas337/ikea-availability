# IKEA Click & Collect Availability
So sick of refreshing my page to check IKEA availability.
This program checks the *East Palo Alto* location. Feel free to edit it.

**You'll have to setup a Twilio account if you don't have one.**

Setup:
- Create a `config.json` following the `config.example.json` format. Input your Twilio data.

Run:
- `node index`
or 
- `nohup node index &` if you want it to run in the background
